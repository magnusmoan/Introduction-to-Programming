### Problem 5: For-loops & Fibonacci
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of integers. The sequence is defined as:
$$f(0) = 0\\f(1) = 1\\f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)$$
Tasks:
1. Implement a program which calculates the *n*th Fibonacci number. _n_ should be an input from the user.
2. The program should calculate the sum of all Fibonacci up to and including the *n*th number.
3. The list of all the Fibonacci numbers up to the *n*th number should be printed to the screen.
