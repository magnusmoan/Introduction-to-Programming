### Problem 7: File handling, importing, dictionaries and functions
This problem is divided into 3 parts, and each part could potentially be its own function, but that's up to you:
1. Store the *n* first Fibonacci numbers to a file called *fibonacci.txt*. Make sure to re-use the Fibonacci function
   implemented earlier.
2. Read the file your wrote to in the previous step and store the number of occurences of each individual character in
   that file to a dictionary
3. Print the key in the dictionary from the previous step that has the highest value, i.e. print the character that
   appeared most times in the file.
